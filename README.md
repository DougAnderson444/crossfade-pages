# Svelte Crossfade Pages

A simple example app of how to fade between routing pages in Svelte.

You can use dynamic routing with adapter-static, so this should work with static servers like Github Pages.

This demo allows you to create a bunch of links to pages, pages which are created and named on the fly, and navigate to those pages. The pages cross fade and the URL changes as you navigate.
